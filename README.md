# tbamud_adventurers_lair

This repository contains the data and runtime files for the tbaMUD Adventurer's Lair instance.

## Default admin account

A starter admin account is pre-provisioned so you can log in immediately:

- **Account:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

Account files live under `plrfiles/accounts/`. The MUD will create the directory tree automatically if it is missing, but the seeded admin files here ensure the account is available out of the box.
