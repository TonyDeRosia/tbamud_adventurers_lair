# tbamud_adventurers_lair

This repository contains the code and game data for the tbaMUD Adventurer's Lair instance. Runtime state is generated by the server and must remain outside of version control.

## Account data

Account files live under `lib/plrfiles/accounts/` at runtime. The MUD will create the directory tree automatically if it is missing. Keep those files on disk only—do not commit them to git.
